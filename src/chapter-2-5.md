While the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in environmental protection are vast, there are also several challenges and limitations that must be considered. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the major limitations and challenges of AI in environmental protection.

Data Quality
------------

AI models rely heavily on high-quality data to make accurate predictions and decisions. In many cases, however, data on environmental conditions may be incomplete, outdated, or biased. This can result in inaccurate predictions and decisions, which can have negative impacts on the environment.

Bias and Fairness
-----------------

AI models can perpetuate existing biases and inequalities if they are trained on biased data or developed without considering how their outputs will impact different groups of people. It is important to consider issues of bias and fairness when developing and deploying AI systems for environmental protection.

Complexity and Uncertainty
--------------------------

The environmental challenges we face are often complex and uncertain. AI models may struggle to account for all the variables involved, and their predictions may be less accurate as a result. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding environmental challenges may make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-based solutions.

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

AI-based solutions for environmental protection may raise ethical concerns around issues such as privacy, surveillance, and autonomy. It is important to carefully consider these issues when developing and deploying AI systems in this context.

Limited Resources
-----------------

Developing and deploying AI systems requires significant resources, including data, expertise, and computational power. These resources may not be available in all contexts, which could limit the potential for AI to contribute to environmental protection efforts.

Conclusion
----------

While AI has the potential to make a significant contribution to environmental protection efforts, there are several challenges and limitations that must be addressed. By carefully considering issues of data quality, bias and fairness, complexity and uncertainty, ethical considerations, and limited resources, we can develop AI-based solutions that are more effective, equitable, and sustainable.
